# SiegeTactics

## Basic idea
It suppose to be a strategy puzzle game. The player is a commander/general who plans whole battle tactics but not really attends the battle. Two phases:
 1. Planing: player plan paths for units, formations and behaviors.
 2. Battle: after the battle begins player has only limited possibility to give orders - sending messenger runner (can be killed).

### Units
All units will be autonomous. Player can give orders about their basic behavior, path and so on. 

## Future plans
 - I'd like to add level designer. In the future, players could make their own levels and hopefully share it.
 - PVP mode: two players choose one level and sites. Then both players create attack/defenf plans and start the battle.

# Platform
The game is written using [Processing for Android](https://android.processing.org/) and is mostly written in [APDE Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsignlabs.apde).
